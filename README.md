# Delta Force Aimbot – Snap Heads, Dominate with Surgical Precision 🔫🌐

### 🎯 Core Aimbot Capabilities

* **Head/Torso Lock‑On**: Aimbot targets can lock onto specific hitboxes like head or body for optimized kill potential 
* **Adjustable FOV Radius**: Define the visible lock-on range using a sight-radius circle&#x20;
* **Smooth Aim & Magnetism**: Mimic human-like tracking with smooth movement; includes legit “soft aim” settings 
* **Triggerbot Functionality**: Auto-fires precisely the moment your crosshair aligns with a valid enemy hitbox 
* **Prediction Engine**: Tracks enemy movement for accurate shots even during portal flanks or strafing 
* **Vision Checks**: Ensures aim only locks when enemy is visible (e.g. not behind walls/glass) 

### 🔧 Behavior Modes

* **Legit Mode**: Lower smooth strength and FOV for subtle aim assist.
* **Semi‑Legit Mode**: Faster snap with cautious FOV limits.
* **Rage Mode**: Max-speed head locking, aggressive—but conspicuous.
